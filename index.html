      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The United States has focused on decreasing healthcare costs. US spending is the <strong>most expensive in the world</strong>, 
        with costs projected to rise through 2020. Data showed that in 2013, the US spent approximately <strong>17% of its gross domestic 
        product (GDP) on healthcare</strong>, which is significantly higher than health care spending in other countries. Despite high health 
        care spending, the US shows <strong>poorer results</strong> for certain health care outcomes compared with other countries e.g. lower 
        life expectancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted and signed into law in 2010,</strong> has made many changes to reimbursements in healthcare. 
        One involved linking part of hospital pay to Patient Experience/Customer Satisfaction scores. In 2012, Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, 
        the largest single payor for healthcare, has started to <strong>modify payments based on quality performance/outcomes.</strong> This included how 
        hospitals score on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hcahpsonline.org/">Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS)</a>, first national, 
        standardized, publicly-reported survey of patients' perspectives of hospital care.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pressure on hospital finances has driven some<strong> hospitals to close or consolidate and streamline to improve on overall performance.</strong>
        With hospitals capability to directly impact outcomes in their service areas, it is equally critical to understand <strong>impact of their presence on 
        Mortality Rate.</strong>Â The objective of our study is to explore relationships between <strong>Patient Experience rating, Mortality Rate, and Number 
        of Hospitals by County.</strong>
